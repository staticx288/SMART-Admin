# 🏛️ SMART-PolicyCentral Framework

**Domain-Organized Storage. Version Control Repository. Master Records.**

---

## 🧭 Overview

**SMART-PolicyCentral** is the domain-organized storage repository for all SmartContracts across the SMART ecosystem. Each domain (CP, LP, Weld, Paint, etc.) has its own dedicated storage area with complete version history.

**PolicyCentral is storage only** - contract creators store their completed contracts here organized by domain.

## 🧩 Core Functions

### 1. 🗂️ Master Version Control Repository

PolicyCentral maintains **domain-organized storage** with complete version history:

```
SMART-Vault/
  CP-Domain/
    SmartCompliance/
      v1.0/CP-RedDye.yaml
      v1.1/CP-RedDye.yaml ← current
    SmartMaintenance/
      v1.0/CP-Equipment.yaml ← current
    SmartSP/
      v1.0/CP-Process-A.yaml ← current
  LP-Domain/
    SmartCompliance/
      v1.0/LP-Green.yaml
      v1.1/LP-Green.yaml ← current
    SmartSP/
      v1.0/LP-Surface-Prep.yaml ← current
  Weld-Domain/
    SmartStandards/
      v1.0/AWS-D1.1.yaml ← current
    SmartCompliance/
      v1.0/Weld-Safety.yaml ← current
  Paint-Domain/
    SmartCompliance/
      v1.0/Paint-Booth.yaml ← current
```

**Version management:**
- **Complete history preserved** - all versions maintained permanently
- **Current version tracking** - latest deployed version clearly identified  
- **Draft version support** - work-in-progress contracts stored safely
- **Immutable versions** - deployed versions cannot be modified

### 2. � Domain-Organized Storage

**Each domain has dedicated storage areas:**

- **CP-Domain** → All CP-related contracts (SmartCompliance, SmartMaintenance, SmartSP, SmartStandards)
- **LP-Domain** → All LP-related contracts (SmartCompliance, SmartMaintenance, SmartSP, SmartStandards)
- **Weld-Domain** → All Welding-related contracts (SmartCompliance, SmartMaintenance, SmartSP, SmartStandards)
- **Paint-Domain** → All Paint-related contracts (SmartCompliance, SmartMaintenance, SmartSP, SmartStandards)
- **Additional domains** → Each domain gets its own dedicated folder/HDD storage

**Storage organization:**
1. Contract creators store completed contracts in appropriate domain folder
2. Version history maintained through folder structure within each domain
3. Each domain can have its own dedicated HDD for storage
4. Domain-specific contracts organized by contract type within domain folders
5. Complete isolation between domains for security and organization

### 3. � Contract Library Services

**Provides contract lookup and reference services:**

- **Contract repository** - maintains complete library of all contract versions
- **Version lookup** - contract creators can reference previous versions
- **Template library** - provides base templates for contract creation
- **Contract genealogy** - tracks evolution of contract families

**Library services:**
1. Contract creators store new versions in PolicyCentral
2. Version history maintained through folder structure
3. Contract creators handle their own deployment to nodes
4. PolicyCentral provides lookup and reference services
5. Complete audit trail of all contract versions maintained

### 4. 📋 Master Record Management

**Authoritative source for all contract information:**

- **Contract genealogy** - complete evolution history of every contract
- **Deployment audit trails** - record of all contract deployments and updates
- **Contract integrity verification** - cryptographic signatures and checksums
- **Cross-reference services** - lookup contracts by name, version, or deployment status

---

## 🛡️ Governance & Security

- **Domain storage authority** - only PolicyCentral maintains domain-organized contract storage
- **Version immutability** - stored contract versions cannot be modified
- **Domain isolation** - each domain has dedicated storage areas
- **Version tracking** - maintains record of all contract versions within domains
- **Audit trail** - complete history of all contract storage by domain

### Integration Points
- **Contract Creators**: Store completed contracts in appropriate domain folders
- **PolicyNodeStorage**: Receives contracts deployed by contract creators
- **SMART-Ledger**: Logs all contract storage and versioning activities
- **Domain Teams**: Access domain-specific contract storage areas
- **Audit Systems**: Reference stored contracts for compliance verification
