## 📘 SMART-ClientManager Framework

**Know the Client. Build the Contract. Track the Relationship.**

---

## 👥 Overview

**SMART-ClientManager** is the CRM/CSM module of the SMART-Stack.
It governs client metadata, PO intake, SmartClientPO conversion, feedback tracking, billing linkage, and long-term relationship intelligence.

This is not sales CRM — it's operations-rooted, contract-aware, and directly tied to SMART-SmartContracts, SMART-Pay, and SMART-Feedback.

Each client becomes a fully traceable, auditable, and automatable entity — without adding SaaS-style bloat.
