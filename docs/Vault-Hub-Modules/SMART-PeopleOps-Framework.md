## 📘 SMART-PeopleOps Framework

**Verified Workers. Linked Logic. HR without the Bloat.**

---

## 👥 Overview

**SMART-PeopleOps** is the human infrastructure module of the SMART-ecosystem. It manages staff identity, internal role contracts, work tracking, certification status, and compensation logic through a unified, audit-backed, AI-aware framework.

Unlike traditional HRIS systems, SMART-PeopleOps is tied directly to `SMART-ID`, `SMART-Pay`, and `SMART-SmartContracts`. It replaces disconnected tools and spreadsheets with immutable, structured worker logic that enforces internal policies, enables fair pay, and promotes skills-based mobility.

## ⚙️ Core Functions

### 1. **Verified Worker Identity**

* Every staff member has a `SMART-ID` (human-assigned)
* Linked to biometric login, SmartTag, or traditional auth
* Audit trail includes workstation/device used and operator role

### 2. **SmartContract-Driven Role Terms**

* Workers assigned job contracts based on:

  * Role type (e.g., NDT Level 2, Admin)
  * Job scope (linked to SmartSP or SmartCompliance)
  * Pay model (hourly, fixed, milestone)
* Includes rest cycles, overtime triggers, and audit visibility

### 3. **Unified Training & Safety Management**

* Integrated with **SMART-Education** unified learning system
* **Comprehensive training coordination** for skills, safety, and competency development
* Flags certification expiration or mismatch automatically
* Supervisors may assign learning tracks or role change eligibility
* **Safety incident tracking** impacts training requirements and role assignments
* **Token-based access control** ensures only properly trained staff access appropriate areas/equipment

### 4. **Compliance + Work Log Enforcement**

* All activity tied to SmartContracts
* **Safety compliance monitoring** via **SMART-Safety** integration
* Logged via SMART-Ledger
* Audit alerts for skipped steps, untrained staff, or excessive hours
* **Safety incidents** automatically trigger compliance reviews and retraining

### 5. **Pay Readiness & Billing Signals**

* Sends `SMART-Pay` flags when:

  * Job completed and validated
  * Hour thresholds met
  * Bonus or penalty conditions met
