## 📘 SMART-CertifiedPeople Framework

**Certify the Skill. Enforce the Standard. Protect the Process.**

---

## 👥 Overview

**SMART-CertifiedPeople** is the employee certification and credentialing framework within the BusinessOps domain of SMART. It defines how skills, training, safety protocols, and role eligibility are validated, tracked, and enforced within an operational company environment.

This is not a generalized ecosystem credential system. This is business-aligned certification logic tied to internal SmartContracts, enforced with SMART-ID, tracked via SMART-Ledger, and directly linked to modules like `SMART-PeopleOps`, `SMART-Audit`, `SMART-Compliance`, and **`SMART-Education`** (unified training and safety system).

## 🗃️ Certification Categories

| **Category**                    | **Purpose**                                                                                 |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Skill & Task Verification**   | Certify real-world readiness for roles in NDT, administration, logistics, safety, or QA     |
| **Training Validation**         | Confirms completion of internal safety modules, job-specific SOPs, or SMART-Education tracks|
| **Access Clearance**            | Grants or limits access to test stations, sensitive data, or SmartPO creation tools         |
| **Equipment Authorization**     | Ensures only trained operators use specific equipment (e.g. LP cabinet, ultrasonic scanner) |
| **Compliance Requirement Tags** | Required certs for passing audits, linked to SMART-Compliance and SmartPO pre-checks        |

## ⚙️ Core Functions

### 1. **SmartCredential Assignment**

* Certifications are linked to `SMART-ID`
* Issued via:

  * Completion of **SMART-Education** unified training, safety, and competency modules
  * Completion of SMART-Education modules
  * Supervisor sign-off (optionally multisig)
  * Successful SmartContract completion (e.g. SP walkthroughs)
* Stored immutably in SMART-Ledger
* **Automatic integration with SMART-Education** for comprehensive skill, safety, and competency validation
* **Token-based validation** through SMART-TokenAccessLayer for real-time access control

### 2. **Real-Time Enforcement Hooks**

* Modules like `SMART-Compliance` or `SMART-Gatekeeper` can deny access or flag users if required certs are missing
* **ClientSmartContracts embed certification requirements and validate automatically before execution**
* SmartPO dashboards hide tests until certification logic is verified
* **Token-based validation integrated directly into operational contracts**

### 3. **Expiration, Recertification, Revocation**

* Each cert includes:

  * Issue date
  * Renewal date
  * Auto-expiration or audit-based revocation conditions
* **SMART-Education** automatically schedules recertification training when renewals approach
* **Safety clearance renewals** triggered by protocol updates or incident requirements
* SMART-PeopleOps receives alerts for renewals or failed re-tests
* **Seamless integration** between unified learning completion and certification renewal
* **Token-based access control** automatically updates based on certification status

### 4. **Audit + Compliance Logging**

* All credential actions are logged:

  * Who granted, when, and under what logic
  * Linked test actions, equipment usage, or audit events
* Enables full traceability for ISO/AS9100/FAA compliance readiness
