            3.  Verify the oven is within class 2 calibration per AMS
                2750 and set to 149 degrees F. The temperature shall be
                within 139-159 degrees F, and shall not exceed 160
                degrees F.

            4.  Set the timer for 5 minutes. The parts shall be
                completely dry. There shall be no remnants of water
                anywhere on the part.

            5.  If the parts are not dry, set the timer for an
                additional 4 minutes. The parts shall not be dried for a
                total time of over 10 minutes maximum.

        6.  Op. 5 Develop the parts

            1.  Remove the parts from the oven and take to the viewing
                area

            2.  Spray the parts with the Magnaflux ZP-9F form d,
                Non-Aqueous Developer

            3.  Set the timer for 11 minutes and seconds. The
                development time shall be between 10 minutes minimum and
                1 hour maximum.

            4.  Check the part for development, if the parts are fully
                developed begin the examination process in 9.2.7.

        7.  Op 6. Examination

            1.  Close the viewing area door or lower the black out
                curtain and darken the room.

            2.  Allow your eyes to adapt for a minimum of 1 minute. If
                you leave the darkened area for any reason, your eyes
                will need to re-adapt to the darkened area again for 1
                minute minimum.

                1.  If you wear glasses, this must be recorded in
                    accordance with NAS-410 and you must be wearing
                    them.

                2.  Operators are not allowed to wear photochromic or
                    permanently darkened lenses (sunglasses) when
                    reviewing the parts.

            3.  Examine the parts for relevant indications per the
                customer's acceptance criteria found on the applicable
                specification.

                1.  All areas of fluorescence shall be interpreted.

        8.  Indication Verification

            1.  Dampen a cotton swab with acetone.

            2.  Wipe the indication perpendicular to the length of the
                indication.

                1.  **Operators are prohibited from swabbing the area
                    more than twice.**

            3.  Allow the area to dry

            4.  Spray developer on the area and set a time for 3 minutes
                and 15 seconds. The minimum redevelopment time shall be
                3 minutes.

            5.  If the indication does not reappear, the indication may
                be considered false.

        9.  Indication Sizing

            1.  Evaluate the found indication by measuring the
                indication at its largest dimension with a **measuring
                device** against the customer's acceptance criteria

            2.  Record any found indications or discontinuities that
                break the customer's acceptance criteria

        10. Op. 7 Post-Cleaning

            1.  Remove the parts from the viewing area

            2.  Wipe each part with acetone

            3.  Packaged the parts as they arrived for further
                processing

    3.  End of Job

        1.  Put all used rags in the red flammable waste bin

        2.  Return cans to shelf and write open-date on label if first
            use

        3.  Hang up PPE properly

        4.  File the completed inspection form for the job

11. Final Inspection Release

All acceptance criteria of the Final Inspection Release Table shall be
completed and in compliance with the appropriate acceptance criteria
specification before any penetrant job per this process planning form
can be issued a certificate of conformance (form QP-850-F1) for the
customer. The acceptance criteria are derived from the specifications
listed in Table 4. Any acceptance criteria that are not in compliance
with the appropriate specification shall be handled per QP-8800 and a
corrective action per QP-1010 shall be issued. When penetrant inspection
is performed on the first piece of a new part number or after major
