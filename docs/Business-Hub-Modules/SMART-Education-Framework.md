## 📘 SMART-Education Framework

**Learn. Train. Certify. Stay Safe. All in One.**

---

## 👥 Overview

**SMART-Education**  is the unified learning, training, and safety validation engine of the SMART system. It consolidates all educational content—from role onboarding and skills training to safety protocols and compliance briefings—into a single, trackable, token-validated framework directly tied to SMART-CertifiedPeople, SMART-PeopleOps, and SMART-TokenAccessLayer.

This is not a general-purpose education platform. It's a comprehensive, audit-ready learning system that transforms onboarding, SOP walkthroughs, safety briefings, skills training, and competency validation into certifiable logic with integrated token-based access control.

**Train with Purpose. Certify with Confidence. Track with Logic.**

## ⚙️ Core Functions

### 1. **Unified Learning Management System**

* **SmartTrack Curriculum Engine**: 
  * Role-based learning paths with skills progression tracking
  * Safety-integrated training modules with real-time protocol updates
  * Auto-linked to SMART-CertifiedPeople for credential generation
  * Stored in flat JSON or Markdown (for offline/station use)

* **Competency & Safety Validation Logic**:
  * Skills assessments with hands-on competency validation
  * Safety protocol testing with emergency scenario simulations
  * Environmental safety training (temperature, pressure, radiation monitoring)
  * PPE compliance verification and equipment authorization training

### 2. **Token-Integrated Access Control**

* **Training Validation Tokens**: Issued via SMART-TokenAccessLayer upon completion
  * `TrainingComplete` tokens for skills-based access control
  * `SafetyCertified` tokens for hazardous environment access
  * `EmergencyTrained` tokens for emergency response authorization
  * `CompetencyValidated` tokens for equipment operation clearance

* **Embedded Contract Validation**:
  * Training/safety requirements **embedded directly into ClientSmartContracts**
  * No separate training contracts - validation logic built into operational contracts
  * SmartContract execution automatically checks for required tokens before proceeding
  * Contract-level enforcement ensures compliance without additional overhead

* **Progressive Access Logic**:
  * Basic → Intermediate → Advanced skill pathways
  * Safety clearance levels tied to specific hazard categories
  * Cross-training tokens for multi-role flexibility

### 3. **Real-Time Safety Integration**

* **Live Safety Protocol Training**:
  * Environmental monitoring training (integrated with node safety systems)
  * Incident response simulation and emergency procedure drills
  * PPE compliance training with hands-on verification
  * Hazard-specific training triggered by operational changes

* **Safety Incident Learning**:
  * Post-incident mandatory retraining with updated protocols
  * Near-miss analysis training for prevention awareness
  * Safety culture development through real scenario discussions

### 4. **Automated Certification & Recertification**

* Completion triggers:
  * Competency assessments with practical demonstrations
  * Safety protocol testing with emergency scenario validation
  * Manual supervisor sign-off for complex procedures
  * Token-based verification through SMART-TokenAccessLayer

* Success automatically:
  * Writes to SMART-Ledger with immutable completion records
  * Issues appropriate access tokens via SMART-TokenAccessLayer
  * **Embeds training/safety validation into ClientSmartContracts**
  * Updates SMART-CertifiedPeople certification status
  * Triggers SMART-PeopleOps profile updates for role access

### 5. **Intelligent Recertification Scheduling**

* Automatically schedules:
  * Skills refresher training (quarterly/annual based on role criticality)
  * Safety protocol updates when new hazards are identified
  * Emergency response drills and competency validation
  * Equipment-specific retraining when tools/procedures change

* SMART-PeopleOps integration:
  * Alerts supervisors of approaching renewal deadlines
  * Flags workers with expired safety or skills certifications
  * Prevents access to restricted areas/equipment without valid tokens

### 6. **Offline-Capable Deployment**

* Training content deployable to:
  * BusinessOps Hub for comprehensive learning management
  * Test Station Nodes for job-specific training delivery
  * Field Tablets for safety refreshers and emergency procedures
  * Safety Terminals for real-time protocol updates

* Syncs all training completions, safety validations, and token issuance when back online
