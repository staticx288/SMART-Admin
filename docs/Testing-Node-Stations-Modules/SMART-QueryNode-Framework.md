# ✅ SMART-NodeQuery Framework
**Ask It. Say It. Trust It. Voice-Driven Intelligence at the Node.**

---

## 🎙️ Overview

**SMART-NodeQuery** is a voice-first query and result-recording system embedded into every SMART-Node. Designed to act like a station-specific **hands-free assistant**, it allows technicians to **ask questions or log results using voice only**.

Every query is answered using **only the local node's verified documents**—including SmartPOs, SOPs, Standards, and Certifications. If an action can't be fulfilled via voice, the system prompts the user to use the terminal interface.

## 🧠 How It Works

- **Wake Word**: Saying “**SMART**” activates the system
- **Acknowledgment**: The system replies with “**Yes**” or “**Ready**”
- **Voice Query**: User asks a question or gives a command
- **Local Answering**: The node provides answers based on its own documents
- **Fallback**: If a request can’t be handled via voice, system says:
  > “**Cannot perform this action. Please use terminal.**”

## 🔧 Core Functions

### ❓ **Query Examples**
- "What are the PPE requirements for this job?"
- "Is the current SmartPO still valid?"
- "What is the hold time for Tank 2?"

### 🧾 **Voice-Logged Test Results**
- "SMART." → "Yes."  
  "Record pressure reading as 125 PSI."
- "SMART." → "Ready."  
  "Log weld test result as passed."
- Result is stored and logged to the node ledger
- Confirmation response: "**Recorded.**" or fallback message

### 🎙️ **Client Communication (Premium Service)**
- **Client-to-Technician**: Secure voice channel for real-time questions
- **Process Inquiries**: "Can you show me the surface preparation on that area?"
- **Specification Verification**: "What dwell time are you using for this part?"
- **Quality Oversight**: Direct communication during critical test phases
- **All conversations logged** to SMART-Ledger with participant identification

## 🛡️ Access & Guardrails

- **SMART-ID** ensures only authorized users can issue certain commands
- **SMART-Compliance / Standards** serve as reference sources

---

## 📓 Logging & Audit Trail

All interactions are:
- Logged to SMART-Ledger with:
  - `OperatorID`
  - `NodeID`
  - Timestamp
  - Query or command issued
- Auditable by SMART-Audit module

---
