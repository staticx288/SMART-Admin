# 🔧 SMART-MaintenanceNode Framework

**SmartMaintenance Contract Executor. Tool Calibration. Equipment Care. Immutable Logging.**

SMART-MaintenanceNode is a **module component** running on every testing node to **execute SmartMaintenance contracts** for tool calibration and equipment maintenance. Once loaded with SmartMaintenance contracts from MaintenanceHub, this module executes maintenance contract logic autonomously with zero dependencies.

## 🌐 Core Functions

### **SmartMaintenance Contract Execution**
- Executes SmartMaintenance contracts linked to active SmartClientPOs
- Enforces maintenance conditions for tool calibration and equipment readiness
- Validates equipment calibration status before testing operations
- Provides immediate feedback on equipment maintenance requirements

### **Tool Calibration Management**
- Monitors calibration schedules and validation requirements per SmartMaintenance contracts
- Tracks calibration certificates and equipment certification status
- Validates tool accuracy and measurement precision according to contract specifications
- Ensures equipment meets calibration requirements before test execution

### **Equipment Maintenance Validation**
- Executes equipment maintenance checks as defined in SmartMaintenance contracts
- Validates equipment operational status and maintenance compliance
- Monitors equipment condition against SmartMaintenance contract requirements
- Documents equipment readiness and maintenance compliance status

### **SmartMaintenance Contract Logging**
- Logs every SmartMaintenance contract execution and calibration validation to `SMART-Ledger`
- Creates tamper-proof audit trail of equipment maintenance and calibration actions
- Documents maintenance contract decisions with full context and contract reference
- Maintains immutable record of tool calibration and equipment maintenance history
