# 🛡️ SMART-SafetyNode Framework

**SmartSafety Contract Executor. Safety Protocol Enforcement. Immutable Logging.**

SMART-SafetyNode operates as a node module to **execute SmartSafety contracts** for safety protocol enforcement and personnel protection. Once loaded with SmartSafety contracts from SafetyCentral, node modules execute safety contract logic autonomously.

## 🌐 Core Functions

### **SmartSafety Contract Execution**
- Executes SmartSafety contracts linked to active SmartContracts
- Enforces safety protocol conditions and hazard protection requirements
- Validates safety compliance per SmartSafety contract specifications
- Blocks unsafe operations when SmartSafety contract conditions are not met

### **Safety Protocol Validation**
- Validates safety procedures against SmartSafety contract requirements
- Ensures environmental conditions meet safety standards as defined in contracts
- Confirms proper safety equipment usage and PPE compliance according to contract logic
- Monitors safety protocol status against contract-defined safety criteria

### **Safety Emergency Response**
- Executes emergency procedures as defined in SmartSafety contracts
- Triggers safety shutdowns and protective measures per contract specifications
- Manages emergency response according to SmartSafety contract protocols
- Documents emergency actions with full context and contract reference

### **SmartSafety Contract Logging**
- Logs every SmartSafety contract execution and safety validation to `SMART-Ledger`
- Creates tamper-proof audit trail of safety contract enforcement actions
- Documents safety contract decisions with full context and contract reference
- Maintains immutable record of safety protocol execution and emergency response history
