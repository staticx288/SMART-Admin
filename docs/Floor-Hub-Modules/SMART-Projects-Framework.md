## SMART-Projects Framework

**Mission-Driven. Transparently Managed. Operationally Precise.**

---

## 🔍 Overview

SMART-Projects is the centralized coordination and lifecycle engine for all operational and deployment projects in the SMART ecosystem. It manages inspection campaigns, equipment rollouts, infrastructure upgrades, compliance fixes, and client onboarding efforts with audit-verified precision and real-time visibility.

Every job is treated as a digitally governed project, using SmartContracts to define scope, assigned SMART-IDs for accountability, and SMART-Ledger for immutable event chains.

This isn’t just project tracking—it’s auditable execution for high-stakes industrial work.

## 🛠️ Project Types

| Type                    | Description                                                         |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inspection Jobs**     | NDT methods: Ultrasonic, Radiographic, Magnetic, Visual, etc.       |
| **Install Projects**    | Hardware installs, SMART-Grid, Conduit integration, power/comm setup|
| **Tech Deployment**     | AI Boxes, Node setups, Portal launches, Timeclock upgrades          |
| **Maintenance/Repair**  | Equipment servicing, calibration updates, corrective maintenance    |
| **Internal Ops**        | Internal workflow upgrades, AI tuning, automation projects, etc.    |

## ⚙️ Core Features

### **AI-Coordinated Project Management**

* SMART-AI generates critical path, dependencies, and delay alerts
* Dashboards track all milestones with full traceability
* SmartContract drives scope and job logic, not spreadsheets

### **SmartContract-Driven Execution**

* Each project is anchored by a SmartContract
* Test requirements, standards, pre-checks defined at creation
* Enforced by receiving Node modules and verified by SMART-Oracles

### **Role-Based Team Assignments**

* Roles: Project Lead, Assigned Techs, QA Reviewers, Compliance Officers
* Only users with proper certification (checked via SMART-ID) can act
* Every action logged with user SMART-ID in SMART-Ledger

### **Trigger-Based Flow**

* SmartContract triggers control job flow:

  * Unlock next milestone
  * Notify client/internal stakeholders
  * Trigger inspection report generation
* Can trigger SMART-Pay releases, SMART-Audit checks, or hold logic

### **Client/Manager Visibility**

* Optional visibility via SMART-Portals
* Real-time dashboards show current status, blockers, next steps
* Full timeline history for any project

## 🔒 Governance Layers

| Layer             | Responsibility                                                  |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Ops Manager**   | Oversees entire lifecycle, staffing, SmartContract approval     |
| **QA Supervisor** | Ensures tests follow compliance and industry standards          |
| **SMART-Admin**   | Assigns SMART-IDs, permissions, and scope for each participant  |
| **SMART-Audit**   | Validates ledger trail, timestamps, compliance enforcement      |

All data is logged to the Node’s SMART-Ledger and mirrored to NAS for historical audits.

## 📌 Final Thoughts

SMART-Projects is more than task tracking. It's operational discipline with governance-grade traceability. For regulated, safety-critical work like NDT, it’s the only way to scale precision.

**SMART-Projects: Run smarter. Build faster. Deliver with confidence.**
