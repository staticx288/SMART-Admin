# 🔧 SMART-MaintenanceHub Framework

**SmartMaintenance Contract Creator. Contract Deployment Hub. Equipment Management Logic.**

SMART-MaintenanceHub creates and deploys **SmartMaintenance contracts** that define equipment maintenance and calibration requirements. It packages maintenance logic into executable SmartContracts and deploys them to MaintenanceNode modules running on every testing node. Once deployed, node modules execute SmartMaintenance contracts autonomously for equipment management.

## 🌐 Core Functions

### **SmartMaintenance Contract Creation**
- Creates SmartMaintenance contracts with equipment maintenance conditions (`must-calibrate-before-test`, `require-maintenance-acknowledgement`)
- Develops contract logic for equipment maintenance and calibration validation
- Packages maintenance requirements into executable SmartContract format
- Maintains master SmartMaintenance contract templates and versions

### **Equipment Management Contract Logic**
- Defines equipment maintenance conditions that must be met before operations
- Creates contract logic for calibration validation and equipment readiness enforcement
- Develops SmartMaintenance contract execution rules for testing environments
- Establishes equipment management contract parameters and validation criteria

### **SmartMaintenance Contract Deployment**
- Packages SmartMaintenance contracts for deployment to MaintenanceNode modules on every testing node
- Manages secure distribution of equipment maintenance contracts to node modules
- Tracks SmartMaintenance contract deployment status and node module acknowledgment
- Maintains deployment history and contract version control

### **Equipment Management Contract Management**
- Creates SmartMaintenance contracts and stores them in SMART-PolicyCentral
- Version control managed through repository folder structure (v1.0/, v1.1/, v1.2/)
- Contracts contain pure logic only - no embedded version numbers
- All newly created contracts automatically pushed to nodes after repository storage

### **Alert Reception & Response**
- Receives alerts from MaintenanceNode stations about critical equipment issues
- Processes alert data to identify contract logic problems
- Develops new SmartMaintenance contract versions based on alert patterns
- Maintains alert history for contract improvement decisions

## 🛡️ Governance & Security

- **SmartContract creation authority** - only Central can create/modify SmartMaintenance contracts
- **Deploy and release** - once deployed, nodes execute SmartMaintenance contracts autonomously
- **No runtime control** - Central cannot interfere with SmartMaintenance contract execution
- **Contract integrity** - immutable SmartMaintenance contract versioning and deployment logging
- **Audit trail** - complete history of SmartMaintenance contract creation and deployment

### Integration Points
- **MaintenanceNode Modules**: Deploys SmartMaintenance contracts to modules running on every testing node
- **SMART-Ledger**: Logs all SmartMaintenance contract creation and deployment activities
- **SMART-AlertBroadcast**: Receives alerts about SmartMaintenance contract execution issues from node modules
- **SmartClientPO System**: Links SmartMaintenance contracts to active testing orders

- Contract genealogy and evolution tracking for equipment management
- Deployment audit trails and SmartMaintenance contract change documentation
- SmartMaintenance contract integrity verification

### **Alert-Based Intelligence**
- Analysis of alert patterns from MaintenanceNode modules across all testing nodes
- Identification of contract logic issues requiring updates
- Development of new SmartMaintenance contract templates based on alerts
- Contract improvement decisions driven by node module-reported equipment issues
