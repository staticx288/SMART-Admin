# SMART-Dashboards Framework

**See only what matters. Enforce what must happen. Prove what did.**

---

## 👭 Overview

**SMART-Dashboards** is the real-time visual interface layer of the SMART-Stack. Designed to turn SmartClientPOs, node activities, and audit trails into actionable views, each dashboard adapts to its audience—whether on the test floor, in executive strategy rooms, or inside client portals.

This is more than a dashboard. It’s dynamic infrastructure visibility, smart contract execution feedback, and real-time compliance assurance—rendered as live, modular interfaces.

## ⚙️ Dashboard Categories

| **Category**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Testing Node Dashboards** | Automatically generated from SmartClientPOs. Show only required tests per part. Enforces execution order, hides tests until pre-checks are complete. |
| **BusinessOps Dashboards**  | Multi-view dashboards for HR, Contracts, Maintenance, Logistics, etc. Tailored for operations and execs.                                       |
| **Client Dashboards**       | Real-time test tracking, delivery milestones, document access, optional live Q&A module.                                                       |
| **Compliance Dashboards**   | Pre-check completions, missed flags, test procedure adherence. Works with Standards & Audit modules.                                           |
| **Financial Dashboards**    | SmartContract fulfillment, per-node cost centers, audit-linked anomalies, ROI heatmaps.                                                        |
| **Fallback & Recovery**     | Node health, SmartContract reroutes, SMART-Core failover paths, field recovery triggers.                                                        |

## 🌟 Core Functions

### 1. **SmartClientPO-Driven Node Interfaces**

* Each SmartClientPO defines the required test steps and dashboard layout per job.
* Pre-check enforcement: No test access until validations complete.
* Auto-generates on job load, resets after test completion.

### 2. **BusinessOps Strategy Dashboards**

* Provides facility-wide insight across HR, contract flow, asset movement, and operations.
* AI/VI inject optimization suggestions, flag bottlenecks, and highlight upcoming priorities.

### 3. **Client Transparency Layer**

* Track project and test status in real time.
* Role-based data views with linked reports and media.
* Optional messaging panel for real-time client questions.

### 4. **Audit-Integrated Compliance Visibility**

* Linked to SMART-AuditLogger and SMART-Compliance.
* Dashboards show test adherence, operator certs, missed checkpoints, and ledger timestamps.
