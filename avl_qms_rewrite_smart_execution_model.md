# Quality & AVL Support Overview

## Quality Management System (Execution-Based)

Quantum Engineering operates an **execution-based Quality Management System** aligned to AS9100 requirements. All production, inspection, and compliance activities are governed by **SMART workflows that verify execution readiness before work proceeds**.

Written procedures, manuals, and work instructions may exist for reference and standards alignment; however, **they are not used to execute work**. Execution occurs only through system-verified workflows, ensuring required prerequisites, authorizations, and conditions are satisfied prior to progression. Audits and management review evaluate **system behavior, trends, and anomalies**, rather than reconstructing events after execution.

---

## Special Process Control

All special processes are executed through **SMART-verified workflows** that validate readiness prior to each execution step. The system verifies required conditions at runtime, including:

- Personnel identity and qualification status  
- Job and customer authorization scope  
- Required process parameters and prerequisites  
- Oversight and approval conditions where applicable

Progression is **permitted only when all required conditions are satisfied**. No special process can enter an invalid execution state. Records and evidence are generated automatically as a result of verified execution.

---

## Training & Certification Control

Personnel qualifications and certifications are maintained as **system-verifiable attributes**, not static records.

- Required certifications are validated prior to assignment  
- Expiration and renewal requirements are continuously monitored  
- Execution eligibility is verified in real time  
- Level III oversight requirements are validated as part of execution readiness

Personnel may not be assigned to work unless all required qualifications are verified by the system at runtime.

---

## Corrective Action & Risk Management

Corrective action and risk management activities are integrated into SMART as **tracked system events**, not standalone paperwork.

- Nonconformances and anomalies are linked directly to execution events  
- Root cause analysis and corrective actions are system-recorded  
- Risk conditions are visible in real time  
- Management review evaluates **system performance**, not isolated incidents

This supports continuous improvement without reliance on episodic audits or manual reconstruction.

---

## Execution, Traceability & Records

SMART functions as the **operational authority** for all work execution. Traceability is **produced automatically as a byproduct of verified execution**, not manually recorded.

For each execution step, SMART binds:

- Personnel identity and authorization  
- Qualification and certification status  
- Process parameters and execution state  
- Timestamped completion evidence

All records are stored as **immutable, audit-ready digital records** with controlled, read-only access for audit and customer review. No third-party QMS or MES tools are required to generate or maintain traceability.

## Prime & New Space Positioning

### Traditional Primes (Boeing / Bell / RTX)

- Tiered onboarding and SQE engagement  
- AS9100 alignment with NADCAP progression  
- Reduced oversight burden through system-verified execution

**Differentiation:** Audits observe system behavior rather than reconstructing events.

### New Space (SpaceX / Blue Origin / Emerging Programs)

- Accelerated onboarding  
- Controlled acceptance of in-progress certifications  
- Rapid iteration without relaxing controls

**Positioning Statement:**

> *Quantum reduces supplier risk by verifying execution readiness in real time, enabling speed without relying on paperwork-driven approvals.*
